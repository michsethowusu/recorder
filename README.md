Welcome! This tool helps you record audio in your local language for our dataset. Your recordings will help improve language technology and digital accessibility. Follow the steps below to get started.

## How to Start

1. **Install Python**:

   Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository**:

   First, download the project files to your computer. Open your terminal and run:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/GhanaNLP/recorder.git
   cd recorder
   ```

3. **Setup the App**:

   Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command inside the project folder:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch the Recorder**:

   Start the application by running:

   ```
   python recorder.py
   ```

5. **Select Your Language**:

   When the app opens, select the language you are recording for (e.g., **Twi**, **Ewe**, or **Dagbani**) from the menu to load the corresponding dataset.

## How to Record

- **Read the Text**: You will see a paragraph or sentence on the screen based on your selected language.
- **Record**: Click the **Record** button and read the text clearly. Use a quiet environment if possible.
- **Review**: You can play back your recording to make sure it sounds good and there are no loud background noises.
- **Save & Next**: Once you are satisfied, move to the next sentence. The app saves your progress automatically.

## Useful Features

- **Resume Anytime**: If you close the app or your computer restarts, simply relaunch and select the same language to pick up exactly where you left off.
- **Bundled Dataset**: All required text is already included in the repository, so you can start contributing immediately.
- **Automatic Sync**: Your progress is periodically backed up to our secure logs to ensure no work is lost.
- **Offline Support**: You can record without an internet connection; the app will sync your progress the next time you are online.

## Finishing Your Task

When you have finished all your assigned recordings:

1. Click the **Export** button in the app.
2. The app will generate a `.zip` file in the `exports/` folder.
3. Send this ZIP file to your project coordinator via email or the agreed-upon platform.

## File Locations

- `recordings/`: This folder stores your individual audio clips.
- `exports/`: This is where your final submission package (`.zip`) will appear.
